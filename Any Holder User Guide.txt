The public domain Any Holder Camera Film Scanner is a platform to enable scanning film/slides with a digital camera using any (most) film holders/carriers.

After sending the CAD file and having the aluminum parts cut (i.e., SendCutSend), or machined at a local machine shop, assembly is simple. 

Install four 1/4-20 standoff bolts to the outer bolt holes that are long enough to lift the platform so that the film plane is at least 1" above the diffused light source when placed underneath the scanner. Add locknuts or nuts and locking washers to both the top bottom of the base.

Insert the desired Film Plate and insert four 5/16-24 x 3/4" bolts from underneath the platform, and through the guide rails. Add washers on both sides, and a wing nut on the top.

Place the assembled scanner on a copystand, and roughly center under a camera. Place your high CRI and diffused light source underneath the scanner.

Add a strip of film or slides to a holder/carrier, and adjust the guide rails so the holder is centered over the opening in the base. Take care to ensure the rails are square withe base. Correct alignment maybe achieved by viewing the image and holder through the camera, or if connected, on a computer screen.

Once aligned you are ready to scan.
