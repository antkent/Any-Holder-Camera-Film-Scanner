Holders; Many are available on Amazon, B&H, etc... and holder/carriers from image scanners or enlargers will likely work. The maximum width that will fit the platform is 5", with a minimum of 2.5", although you could use a narrower holder (e.g., 110 film) if needed by an offset adjustment of the guide rails. The minimum holder length is roughly 3", but longer is better, with no limit.

If you plan to scan the sprocket holes, you may have a hard time finding a holder that allows it, while also holding the film flat. Sadly, Lomography has added a non-slip strip to the current version of holders, so they no longer work for this solution.

Lighting: The light must have a diffuser, and the film plane should be 1" above it. A 99 CRI light source with a full spectrum diffuser would be optimal, but they are either expensive, or hard to come by. A minimum would be 96 CRI, from a reputable company. The brighter the light the better, as it allows the use of a lower ISO, which typically (but not always) increases quality.
